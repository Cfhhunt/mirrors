  Mirrors
  Colin Hunt, 2022

  This p5.js sketch demonstrates the geometric reasoning behind mirrors, showing how reflected images appear at an absolute distance equal to the total distance traveled by a ray of light.
  It does this by tracing the path of a "particle" object as it travels from an observer through a room of mirrors, potentially striking a "diamond" in the room.
  The absolute distance traveled to the diamond is deomonstrated via "ghost rays" that travel in a straight line from the point of reflection on the mirror.
